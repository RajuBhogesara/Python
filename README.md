# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains two Python mini-projects: a Number Guessing Game and a URL Shortener using Tkinter.

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game

### Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based game where the player has to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 6. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Save the code in a file named number_guessing_game.py.
Run the script using the command: python number_guessing_game.py.

## Project 2: URL Shortener
